# BuddhaSpider

BuddhaSpider is a Scrapy project for fetching [91Porn](http://91porn.com/index.php) videos. This is a New Year's gift for everyone. You know what I mean.ðŸ˜œ

# Extracted data

This project extracts videos and their information.The extracted data is 
stored in the sqlite.You can fetch all the videos data from the `buddha.sqlite3` file.

# Running the spiders

Or you can run the spider using the `python start.py` command, such as:

```shell
$ python start.py
```

Note: Maybe you need breakthrough the GFW. Then I will recommend [Lantern](https://getlantern.org/zh_CN/). And if so, you need to check the `PROXY` in `settings.py`.

- scrapy
